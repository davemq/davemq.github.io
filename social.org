I'm trying to get Org Social set up, finally.

The AVATAR validator doesn't understand hashed Gravatar URLs that
don't end in jpeg, jpg or png. Since I've had a Gravatar avatar set up
for a long time, I'd like to use it. I suppose this post will be a
test of how it looks, despite the validator complaining.

Okay, now that I've seen the post, I think I can ignore this
complaint. The Gravatar avatar renders just fine. I'll think about
submitting a change request for this code to recognize that
gravatar.com URLs don't play by these rules. It would also be nice to
have the validator be more granular, e.g. I want it to validate
everything /except/ the AVATAR.
