I'm trying to get Org Social set up, finally.

The AVATAR validator doesn't understand hashed Gravatar URLs that
don't end in jpeg, jpg or png. Since I've had a Gravatar avatar set up
for a long time, I'd like to use it. I suppose this post will be a
test of how it looks, despite the validator complaining.
